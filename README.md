This is not a template. This is a complete application, built on top of React, with all tiny details taken care of so you just need to bring the data to feed it.

Accessibility is a priority in my projects and I think it should be in yours too, so this was developed listening to real screen readers, focus traps and keyboard navigation are available everywhere.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- ðŸ¦® Throughly accessible (developed using screen readers)
- ðŸŒ— Dark theme enabled (load even different images based on theme)
- ðŸ§© Multiple (custom) components
- âš¡ Code splitting
- Tailwind CSS
- React Router
- Heroicons
- Chart.js
- PWA delivering offline-first and app-like experience

### Routing

Routes are separated into two categories, sidebar ([routes/sidebar.js](src/routes/sidebar.js)) and general ([routes/index.js](src/routes/index.js)).

#### Sidebar routes

These are the routes that will show in the sidebar. They expect three properties:

- `path`: the destination;
- `name`: the name to be shown;
- `icon`: an icon to illustrate the item

Item that are used as dropdowns, like the Pages option, don't need a `path`, but expect a `routes` array of objects with `path` and `name`:

```js
// sidebar.js
{
  path: '/app/tables',
  icon: 'TablesIcon',
  name: 'Tables',
},
{
  icon: 'PagesIcon', // <-- this is used as a submenu, so no path
  name: 'Pages',
  routes: [
    // submenu
    {
      path: '/login',
      name: 'Login', // <-- these don't have icons
    },
    {
      path: '/create-account',
      name: 'Create account',
    },
```

#### General (Router) routes

These are **internal** (private) routes. They will be rendered inside the app, using the default `containers/Layout`.

If you want to add a route to, let's say, a landing page, you should add it to the `App`'s router ([src/App.js](src/App.js), exactly like `Login`, `CreateAccount` and other pages are routed.

#### How to add a new page to router?

1. Create your page inside `src/pages`, say `MyPage.js`;
2. Add it to the global router (`src/routes/index.js`)

```js
const MyPage = lazy(() => import('../pages/MyPage'))
```

Then add it to the `routes` array:

```js
{
  path: '/my-page', // the url that will be added to /app/
  component: MyPage, // the page component you jsut imported
}
```

3. If you want to make this page accessible from the sidebar, you have to options:

- add it to the root `routes` array

```js
{
  path: '/app/my-page', // /app + the url you added in routes/index.js
  icon: 'HomeIcon', // the component being exported from src/icons/index.js
  name: 'My Page', // name that appear in Sidebar
},
```

- add it as an option under a dropdown

```js
{
  icon: 'PagesIcon',
  name: 'Pages',
  routes: [
    // submenu
    {
      path: '/app/my-page',
      name: 'My Page',
    },
```

If you're asking where does this `/app` come from, it is from this line inside `src/App.js`, that renders the app:

```jsx
<Route path="/app" component={Layout} />
```
